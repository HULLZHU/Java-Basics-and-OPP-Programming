Here you can see my Java Learning Experience since I started to learn it. My referenced book is <Introduction to Programming> written by
Daniel Liang, and I finished almost all of exercies listed in the book. Plus, I give some my own idea and thinking on my exercising process.
I hope my learning Experience can give all of you a whole view about my love in Programming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
